Web Push Notification is a great way to keep your users engaged with your website and webapplication.
Support for Web Push Notifications is available in all modern browsers.
Imagine being able to send a push notification to your users when you publish a new blog post
or remind them to perform a recurring task.

<x-info>
    No external services are needed. Convey uses a native service worker to handle push notifications.
</x-info>

The setup of Web Push Notifications is not very hard, when you know how to do it.
There is a lot of documentation about it, but it is very scattered.
So I decided to write my own opinionated implementation.
<b>Convey</b> makes it a breeze to implement Web Push.

This package uses
[Laravel Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com){:target="_blank"}
[Laravel Web Push](https://github.com/laravel-notification-channels/webpush){:target="_blank"}
But you can easily adapt it to other frameworks.

## The package

[Convey](https://github.com/uteq/convey) makes it dead simple to integrate Web Push. 

To install the package run on you command line:

```bash
composer require uteq/convey
```

### Installation

After composer is done installing you can simply run the following command:
This will take all the necessary steps to install the package.
There are a lot, but don't worry it will help you through it.
```bash
php artisan convey:install
```

Add the `Uteq\Convey\Concerns\HasWebpush`
trait to your livewire component.
The trait will pick up the `convey:subscribe` event and ask the user if it may send notifications.
You can also add this to a Volt component.

app/Livewire/Page {.filename}
```php
use Uteq\Convey\Concerns\HasWebpush;

class Page extends Component
{
    use HasWebpush;
}
```

<x-info class="text-sm leading-loose">
    When the user pushes the button to subscribe to Web Push Notifications.
    They will be asked for permission.
    If they accept the notification, a subscription will be created for the user.
</x-info>

Using <i>$this->webpushNotifier(Notification::class)</i> you can set the notification that will be sent to the user.
If no notification is set, the user will only be subscribed.

app/Livewire/Page {.filename}
```php
public function mount()
{
    $this->webpushNotifier(Notification::class);
}
```

Add the `NotificationChannels\WebPush\HasPushSubscriptions`
trait to your `User` model. This makes it possible to subscribe a user to notifications.

app/Models/User {.filename}
```php
use Uteq\Convey\HasPushSubscriptions;

class User extends Model
{
    use HasPushSubscriptions;
}
```

### Events

You can also add the `webpushSubscribed` method to your Livewire component.
This way you can test if the subscription works.

app/Livewire/Page {.filename}
```php
#[On('convey::subscribed')]
public function webpushSubscribed()
{
    dd('subscribed');
}
```

Other events
```php
# At this point the user is not yet subscribed to the notification
# Activates when the user pushes the button to subscribe and approves the notification
# This will also be called when the user is already subscribed
#[On('convey::subscribe')]

# When the user pushed the button to unsubscribe
#[On('convey::unsubscribe')]
```

### Subscribe button

Add this to your blade file (can be anywhere).

Option 1: With integrated loading animations {.label}

```php
<x-convey::subscribe-button>
    subscribe
</x-convey::subscribe-button>
```

You can also choose to use this directive `x-convey-subscribe`.
This way you can exactly style the component the way you like.

Option 2: Using an Alpine directive {.label}
```blade
<button x-convey-subscribe>
    Subscribe
</button>
```

### Button modifications
You can modify the button like you would normally do with any html element.
So you can add a loading state or a success state.
An example would be:

To add a succes message you can do the following:

```blade
<button
    x-convey-subscribe
    wire:loading.attr="disabled"
    class="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 rounded-xl"
>
    Subscribe
</button>

@if ($message)
    {{ $message }}
@endif
```

```php
public string $message = null;

#[On('convey::subscribed')]
function webpushSubscribed()
{
    $this->message = 'You are subscribed!';
}
```

### Ready set go 

And you are ready to go!

For more examples please consult: https://github.com/uteq/convey

### iOS

To test on iOS follow these steps:

{.list-decimal .ml-4 .leading-loose .mt-2}
1. Deploy your site.
2. Add the site to your [mobile home screen](https://www.brandeis.edu/its/support/website-shortcut.html){:target="_blank"}
3. Tap on the icon to subscribe to notifications. 

## How it works

### Laravel Web Push
This package uses [Laraval Notifications Channels - Webpush](https://laravel-notification-channels.com/webpush/){:target="_blank"} for the PHP part.

When running `php artisan convey:install` it will install everything needed for Webpush to function.
The Laravel Web Push package is the php part of the package. It will add a migration, a notification and a service provider.
And then it will be able to send notifications to the browser.

Creating and sending a notification is as easy this.

Add the notification class:
```php
use NotificationChannels\WebPush\WebPushMessage;

class Notification extends Notification
{
    public function toWebPush($notifiable, $notification)
    {
        return (new WebPushMessage)
            ->title('Hello World')
            ->icon('/notification-icon.png')
            ->body('Thank you for using our application.')
            ->action('View app', 'view_app')
            ->data(['id' => $notification->id]);
    }
}
```

Then you can send the notification to the user like this:
```php
$user->notify(new Notification);
```

For more info about the php part of the Notifications check out the [Laravel Web Push documentation](https://laravel-notification-channels.com/webpush/){:target="_blank"}.

### Livewire
Livewire is a full-stack framework for Laravel that makes building dynamic interfaces simple, without leaving the comfort of Laravel.
It is used to handle the subscription part of the package.
When the user pushes the button to subscribe to notifications, Livewire will handle the request.

To learn more about Livewire check out the [documentation](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs){:target="_blank"}.

### Service worker

The service worker is installed in your Chrome browser when you visit the site.
The service worker is a javascript file that runs in the background.
It is a native browser feature and is not related to Laravel.

This is how the service worker looks like. 
Using Convey this fill will be added when running `convey:install`.

public/service-worker.js {.filename}
```js
self.addEventListener('push', event => {
    const data = event.data.json();

    event.waitUntil(
        self.registration.showNotification(data.title, {
            body: data.body,
            icon: data.icon,
            tag: data.tag,
            data: {
                url: data.url
            },
        })
    );
});

self.addEventListener('notificationclick', event => {

    const notification = event.notification;
    const url = notification.data.url;

    notification.close();

    event.waitUntil(
        clients.openWindow(url)
    );
});
```

To check if the service worker is installed you can check the application tab in the Chrome dev tools.

![1.1.service-worker.png](/storage/1.1.service-worker.png)

You can click the 'Push' button to send a test notification. 
If this works but the notifications are not sending when using the button, 
then you probably have a problem with your php code.

And I would suggest to start debugging there.

### Manifest

The manifest is a json file that tells the browser how to handle the website.
By adding display: standalone the browser will open the website in a standalone app.
This way it will look like a native app. And you can send push notifications.

This file is also added when running `convey:install`.
Convey will also auto add the manifest to your layout file, if none is present.

```json
{
    "short_name": "webpusher",
    "name": "Webpusher",
    "icons": [

    ],
    "start_url": "/",
    "background_color": "#ffffff",
    "display": "standalone",
    "scope": "/",
    "theme_color": "#ffffff"
}
```

### Subscribe your device for Web Push Notifications

Then I had to set up the registration part

See grace.test

## Troubleshooting
<b>The browser won't ask for my permission when</b>

{.list-disc .text-base .ml-4 .leading-loose .mt-2}
- The browser already asked for permission.
- You are using Valet share.
- You are using a selfsigned certificate.
- You are using a port other than 80 or 443.
- You are visiting a normal browser on the phone. You need to add it to your home screen.

<b>Be sure to</b>
{.list-disc .text-base .ml-4 .leading-loose .mt-2}
- Run `valet secure`
- Or publish your site to a server with a valid certificate. And add the site to your mobile homescreen.
